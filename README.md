# Desafio 2Sow

## About The Project

The challenge was to build a system for user registration. I created a home, login, signup, users, create user and edit user screens. The site is responsive from 414px up. This is the front end of the application. To access the front end, go to the following repository: https://github.com/pedrovsiqueira/2sow.

### Built With:

- [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) - TypeScript is a typed superset of JavaScript that compiles to plain JavaScript.
- [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/) - Node.jsÂ® is a JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine.
- [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) - MongoDB is a general purpose, document-based, distributed database built for modern application developers and for the cloud era.
- [Passport](http://www.passportjs.org/) - Passport - Passport is authentication middleware for Node.js. Extremely flexible and modular, Passport can be unobtrusively dropped in to any Express-based web application. A comprehensive set of strategies support authentication using a username and password, Facebook, Twitter, and more.
